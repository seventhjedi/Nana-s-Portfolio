## Project 1-Student Performance Prediction and Course Improvement 

**Aims of the Study**

The primary aim of this research study is to evaluate online education data to predict student performance and facilitate course improvement. 
**Objectives of the Study**
1. To identify how online learning fits into the modern educational environment.
2. To investigate how important data analysis is for improving course quality and student performance.
3. To evaluate the potential and difficulties related to data analysis in online education.
4. To evaluate models of prediction that can be used to estimate student performance.
5. To identify data-driven tactics for online education course enhancement.

**Methodology**
Primary research entails gathering first-hand information directly from educators, educational institutions, and online learners. Students are surveyed and participate in structured interviews to learn more about their study habits, experiences, and opinions of the online courses. Instructor interviews also shed light on their methods of instruction, methods of evaluation, and observations of student performance. For a deeper understanding of the human factors influencing online education, this primary data is essential. Collecting and analyzing pre-existing data, such as reports, academic studies, and educational databases, is known as secondary research. Using the wealth of knowledge in the academic community, this study looks at trends and best practices in online education. Secondary research is especially helpful in giving the study a more comprehensive theoretical framework and context, which makes it possible to compare the results with previously published works. The gathered data is analyzed using a variety of methodological tools. Predictive modeling uses statistical methods like regression analysis and machine learning algorithms to forecast student performance based on a variety of factors. The procedure of classifying and deriving refrains from open-ended survey questions and interview answers is known as qualitative content examination. Tools for data visualization are working to effectively present results
